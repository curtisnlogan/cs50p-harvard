# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python - My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets from Harvard's CS50P course. I'm currently working my way through the course and am about halfway through. I'm finding it to be a fantastic and enjoyable introduction to Python and programming in general! David J. Malan is a superb lecturer.
